## Concept

Lavaan is a Latent Variable Analysis library used in R.
We will try to port its functionality.
The first step is to port its model format.

## Plan

Get Jison to make language parsing for lavaan models.
Then move on to execution.

## Status

Now thinking we should just test CFA with MODEL objects and DATA and swicth back to MODEL parsing later.


### 10/26/2019

Write a test for this tutorial on CFA then bring the code to it passing.
